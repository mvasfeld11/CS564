In this project, my partner and I  examined the data and applied the principles of database design that we learned in class in order to implement a good relational schema for it. We  then wrote a Python program to transform the data from its JSON form into SQLiteâ€™s load file format, conforming to our relational schema. We created our schema in a SQLite database, loaded our transformed data, and tested it by running some SQL queries over it.
